# csv-file-comparison
Python script for comparing metadata values in two csv files, identifying duplicate fields, and writing results to another CSV file
Script was used on a metadata normalization and enhancement project by University of Illinois library staff. 
It can be used for comparing a column of values from any CSV to a column in another CSV, identifying and labeling duplicate values in another column
To use this script, simply run it with two CSV files for comparison in the same folder as the python code
Script was built and run on a machine with Python 3.7. Has not been tested on earlier versions of Python
